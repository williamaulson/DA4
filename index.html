<h2>Murder with Revenge</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Murder with Revenge is a game where you can murder another player, with revenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Kill another player.
Kill them again.
Make lots of blood.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Anger resolving blood management simulator.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Player 1 uses the WASD keys to move and the Spacebar to shoot in the direction they are moving. Player 2 uses the arrow keys and the return key to shoot in the direction they are moving. The three buttons in the middle of the arena give movement, firing rate, and speed boosts exclusively to the player who touches them first for 7 seconds. Projectiles can reflect off walls and each other.
<p>NOTE: There is a possible bug with firing from all 8 directions not working on every system.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Develop a satisfying and engaging death mechanic.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
A lot of blood. No real death penalty. Low player skill needed for effective killing.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A special dimension exists that allows two creatures to kill themselves an infinite number of times. It is known as the Arena of the Infinite.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You are an unamed little creature. You have a taste for death and blood, lots of blood. Fate has dealt you a winning hand and placed you in the dimension of the Arena of the Infinite. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Little children who have yet to be desensitised to the horrors of reality.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Play as long as you want. Or until too many blood sprites crash the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There is very little strategy to this game other than getting to the powerup buttons as much as possible and trying to spread out your projectiles. Players can try to kill and die in certain areas for maximum blood coverage.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Audio files are from Chrono Trigger. Avatars are from the official Phaser game tutorial. Blood splatters are from public domain searches. All other assets were created by the internal development team.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
No clue. About every game with a top-down view and killing may have influenced this game. Perhaps the original Postal.
