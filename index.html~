<h2>Choose the Organ Recipient</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Choose the Organ Recipient is a game where players have to choose between people competing for an organ donation.
<p>Please Note: I had a difficult time deciding on a method to approach the organ donation theme in the way that I wanted. As a result, the game has poor mechanics and the code uses bad practices.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I would like players to feel unsatisfied with their decisions and to feel the game progression is not balanced or intuitive. Players could also have an increased awareness of their internal preconceptions and how they affect their decisions.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
I would classify this game under a games with a social purpose category.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Players control an avatar character which can be moved with the arrow keys. There are two buttons on the left and right side of the play area. Each button corresponds to the patient above it. Players have 15 seconds to be standing on a button which will select the corresponding patient as the recipient of the donated organ. If no choice is made after 15 seconds neither patient receives the transplant.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Often in games player decisions can be reduced to metrics which take morality out of the decision-making process. The organ donation organizations in the real world have also attempted weighted scores to prioritize individuals waiting on organ donation lists. I am trying to replicate the difficulties and frustrations with the real-world system in the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
There are no win, loss, or score conditions in the game. Players are encouraged to reflect upon their actions at the end of a gameplay session.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game world is supposed to be a representation of some of the elements of a decision-making process in the real world. The buttons are choices, the text is information gathered over time, and the game time represents the constraints our responsibilities place upon us.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The players have been given the responsibility of deciding who is to receive (and not receive) an organ transplant. The player has no idea of the organ involved or the chance of success for the transplant. The only information the player has about the potential recipients is their age and three facts about them.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
While anyone is encouraged to play, some of the patient facts might pertain to subjects which may not be appropriate for all ages.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The game has five decisions of fifteen seconds each. Meaning total playtime is around 75-85 seconds.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
No strategies are needed to play the game. Players may find it beneficial to wait near the center of the play area so they can quickly get to either button after the last fact for the patients has been displayed.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Avatar character is from official Phaser tutorial. All other image assets were made by the internal design team. Sounds files were taken from public domain sound sources.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
There are several games which seek to educate and enlighten players about events, situations, and data. Many of these games are dry as toast which would seem an accurate description of this game.
